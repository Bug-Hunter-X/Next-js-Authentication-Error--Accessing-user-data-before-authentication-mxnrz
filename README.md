# Next.js Authentication Error: Accessing User Data Before Authentication

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications: attempting to access user data before verifying authentication.  The `about.js` page tries to access user details from `getUser()`, which may return `null` if the user isn't authenticated. This leads to an error when the component tries to render `user.email`.

The solution in `aboutSolution.js` showcases how to handle this using conditional rendering or error boundaries to prevent the error.  This example utilizes conditional rendering based on the result of `getUser()`.  For more robust handling, one might employ a dedicated authentication context or a more sophisticated authorization scheme.

## How to reproduce the bug
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/about` in your browser.  You will sometimes see an error due to the random nature of `getUser()`  (50% chance of failure).
